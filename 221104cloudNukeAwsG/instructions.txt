steps taken in mini pc - personal and also in laptop work
in home/tradexy
using ubuntu wsl2
follow steps https://github.com/gruntwork-io/cloud-nuke
if you install brew in linux, then simply use:
brew install cloud-nuke

my suggestion is to use:
cloud-nuke aws --exclude-resource-type iam onecli221105 global --exclude-resource-type iam tradexydev global --exclude-resource-type iam-group AllAccess global --exclude-resource-type iam-group endUsers global --dry-run
check the dry run above - the 2 global users to keep and 2 iam-groups (good to keep)

cloud-nuke aws --exclude-resource-type iam onecli221105 global --exclude-resource-type iam tradexydev global --exclude-resource-type iam-group AllAccess global --exclude-resource-type iam-group endUsers global
then after nuke the defaults (i.e. default VPCs)
cloud-nuke defaults-aws

then in console look at AWS Resource Groups
look for resources to delete and delete manually

other options to use:
cloud-nuke inspect-aws --region us-east-1
cloud-nuke aws --region us-east-1 --region eu-west-1
In AWS, to delete only the default resources, run cloud-nuke defaults-aws
To exclude us: cloud-nuke aws --exclude-region ap-south-1 --exclude-region ap-south-2
time constraints, older...: cloud-nuke aws --older-than 24h
list resources: cloud-nuke aws --list-resource-types
terminate specific resources: cloud-nuke aws --resource-type ec2 --resource-type ami
exclude specific resources: cloud-nuke aws --exclude-resource-type s3 --exclude-resource-type ec2


Best to keep the tradexydev and onecli221105 as these are used for loging and cli, because after nuking everything is then need to login using the root account /email
again need to provide user (tradexydev) password and user access to console
p.s. Installation git cloned in this folder no needed as part of the steps - as just needed the 1 file.
